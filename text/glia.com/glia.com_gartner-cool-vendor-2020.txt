Further, Gartner states that "it is clear that organizations with more mature digital engagement strategies have been able to improve CX metrics, improve first contact resolution, and reduce call volume."Dan Michaeli, CEO & Co-Founder of Glia, said; "We are delighted to be acknowledged as a Cool Vendor in this report by Gartner. We believe that Digital Customer Service is transforming the way businesses interact with their users, opening up new opportunities, and improving the customer journey. Offering the ability to engage customers via chat, voice, or video while simultaneously co-piloting these users through their online journey helps improve the customer experience while simultaneously lowering servicing costs."Gartner's Brian Manusama and Olive Huang state: "With current world events changing the way all business is conducted, enterprises need tools to quickly address situations where both customers and service representatives are working remotely, and customers are forced to do more and more online.
