It was important for me to see that each and every person has access to the same opportunities."MarieSenior Strategic Customer Success Manager"Glia's commitment to DEI absolutely impacted my decision to join. I could sense in the interview process that the company was looking for people with different backgrounds, experiences, and working styles rather than trying to fill a team of people that all fit a particular mold"CourtneyCustomer Success ManagerDEI CommiteeOur executive-sponsored DEI Committee meets regularly to actively promote a diverse, equitable and inclusive company that is free from all forms of discrimination.
