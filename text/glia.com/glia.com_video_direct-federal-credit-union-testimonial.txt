Testimonial1:19Glia Client Experience: Direct FCUDirect Federal Credit Union is a community chartered credit union that serves members that live, work, or attend school in Norfolk or Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts. The credit union has a unique business model, supporting one branch and investing in servicing their members digitally. Direct Federal is one of the fastest growing credit unions in Massachusetts. After completing their core and online banking platform conversion Direct Federal implemented Glia's chat and CoBrowsing solutions, which has transformed the way that they assist their members. Direct FCU's team of chat agents can quickly and easily identify trends and uncover opportunities using the Glia Digital Customer Service (DCS) platform. "We are already seeing tremendous results and are looking forward to expanding that digital channel. We have had a 94% satisfaction score and 64% of survey respondents stated that they would have called if the chat service was unavailable," said Kassandra Martin, Brand and Digital Strategy Manager at Direct Federal. "With robust customer service and intelligent reporting capabilities, Glia has become an important partner of ours," Martin continued. The Direct Federal team worked with Glia's WhiteGlove Service team to implement and optimize their DCS solution.
