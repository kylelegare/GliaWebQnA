Built on conversational AI solutions from Gliaâs recent Finn AI acquisition, GVAs are optimized for banks and credit unions and pre-trained to deliver out-of-the-box value. By fully integrating GVAs into its market-leading platform, Glia offers a single provider solution for Digital Customer Service.Â Gliaâs first virtual assistants, developed specifically for digital banking, are integrated with leading online banking platforms and require no AI training to get started. Equipped to handle 800+ digital banking scenarios right out of the box, they eliminate the need for ramp-up time. GVAs continue to learn, adapt and improve over time, trained on collective (and anonymized) engagements across Gliaâs GVA client base.Â âGlia Virtual Assistants are that rare win-win-win solution, improving efficiency, delivering after-hours support and also enhancing the customer experience. By automating handling of routine service inquiries, live representatives can focus on resolving more complex issues. This reduces costs, accelerates resolution times and boosts customer and employee satisfaction,â said Dan Michaeli, CEO and Co-Founder of Glia.A number of banks and credit unions have already deployed GVAs, seeing a substantial return on investment, including:Â 50%+ containment of customer engagement on average, with some realizing 90%+80% reduction in the Average Wait Time and Average Handle Time24/7/365 service capability for after-hours and holiday coverageThe integration of GVAs into Gliaâs Digital Customer Service offering creates new efficiencies for the deployment and maintenance of virtual assistants on one platform, from a single vendor. This represents significant savings in cost and time compared to internal development using commercial AI platforms. Additionally, they offer shared insights from across the entire GVA user base for best practices.Â âThe proliferation of chatbots and AI technology in general is creating complexity for financial institutions, especially for those developing their own automated solutions. Glia aims to cut through the chaos with virtual assistants that streamline deployment and accelerate time-to-value on our Digital Customer Service platform. Better yet, we continue to enhance the benefit of our GVAs by leveraging our time-tested library of AI-powered responses to help clients meet existing and emerging needs,â said Justin DiPietro, Chief Strategy Officer and Co-Founder of Glia.GVAs are available immediately.
