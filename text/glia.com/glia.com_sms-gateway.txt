Most consumers have access to a mobile device with text messaging. For many (like a majority of millennials) texting is the communication channel of choice. So why not interact with your customers where they are most comfortable?Texts Get NoticedInbound SMS is a must today, but if you're not using outbound SMS in your customer support, loyalty and promotional efforts you're missing out. Recent statistics show that 98% of texts are opened and 90% are acted upon within three minutes. Imagine what that could mean for how you reach your customers and prospects.A World of PossibilitiesIntegrate outbound SMS text alerts with your business applications and marketing technology to power everything from proactive text alerts for security and account-related events to interactive contextual offers on a scheduled or triggered basis.So Much More Than Just TextingGlia's SMS Gateway enables you to achieve a new level of customer communications. Reach your customers in the palm of their hands and delight them with interactive engagements. Provide them the opportunity to seamlessly switch to even richer media such as voice or video with cobrowsing with just one tap.See The VideoSee The VideoImprove customer communications with SMS.Turn Outbound SMS into Two-Way ConversationsEnsure the âImportant Stuffâ is Noticed via Proactive AlertsYou canât count on customers seeing an email or answering a call, but they do read and interact with texts. Send outbound SMS notifications on a scheduled basis (like a pending renewal) or by a triggered event such as unusual account activity. Clients can respond to text alerts when it's most convenient and interact with a chatbot powered by Glia's AIÂ Management, or with one of your operators to quickly process transactions or resolve issues.Energize Your Marketing Campaigns with SMS Prospects and customers often shy away from unsolicited calls. Intrusive forms that are acted upon AFTER the visitor has forgotten you arenât any better. These channels can limit your campaign effectiveness. Sending a promotional text to a valued customer, or inviting pay-per-click prospects to text you while the offer is still relevant, can make the difference between mediocrity and success.Give Callers a Better Alternative to âPlease HoldâNobody likes being stuck waiting to speak to a representative, but callbacks aren't always a practical solution. Phone-to-Text allows you to reduce friction and enhance the customer experience by giving callers the choice to opt-out in the IVR and seamlessly switch to SMS. Engagement can be automated by an intelligent Virtual Assistant or handled by your operators for the customized experience your clients desire.Gateway to a Seamless Digital First ExperienceLike every interaction within the Glia Digital First platform, your end-users can seamlessly switch from SMS to other channels like voice, video chat, and co-browsing without losing connection or context. Plus all interactions are securely tracked in the interaction database to ensure quality control and compliance.This is how it worksExplore the use casesSend Timely NotificationsSee also:Convert Phone Calls into Text ConversationsReinvent How You Serve Your CustomersRequest a DemoâWith Glia we increased our conversion by over 200%âDirector of Digital - Top 10 BankReinventing Customer ServiceHomeCompanyBlogPartnersCareersDEIResourcesDCS Summit PlatformsChannelLessCoBrowsingAI ManagementVideo ChatChatSMSServicesCustomer SuccessSecurityGlia SecurityBounty ProgramSolutionsIncrease SalesModernize SupportCustomer ExperienceDigital-CentricPhone-CentricHome AgentsVideo BankingÂ© Glia Technologies, Inc.
