Would you like me to walk you through?Hi! Yes please!Why Video Banking?Provide the Next Best Thing to In-Person ServiceSee The VideoSee The VideoPeople still like the reassurance of face-to-face interactions with their chosen community banks or credit unions when it comes to matters of finance. However, in-person interactions are not always possible or practical because of incompatible schedules, lack of transportation, specialist availability, or (most recently) social distancing. That doesnât mean you can't provide the benefits of face-to-face assistance from a smiling, knowledgable representative anyway. Whether consumers are sitting in a branch talking to an on-screen remote specialist, or are across town video-chatting on their PCs or phones, one- or two-way Video Banking enables repreentatives in a branch, call center, or home office to serve them at home, work, or on-the-go as if everybody was in the same room.Seeing each other during a remote interaction promotes trust and confidence for consumers, and helps reps gauge customer comprehension, emotional state, and satisfaction!Reasons to Include Video Banking in Your Service OperationsBuild RelationshipsPeople like in-person assistance when it comes to finances.
