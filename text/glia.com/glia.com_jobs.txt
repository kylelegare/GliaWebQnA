They identified that their clientâs main competitive advantage was its superior in-person customer service. They wondered, âHow can we replicate that same, winning experience online?â And so Glia was born. They set out to build a unified Digital Customer Service platform from the ground up, with funding from supportive, tech-savvy investors. The result is a patented, visionary approach to Digital Customer Service that has earned many industry awards and praise from customers and analysts alike.Customer service technology is our passion, but customer service is in our DNA.
