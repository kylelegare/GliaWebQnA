Event14:14DCS Summit 2021 - Elevating the Member Experience Through OnScreen ServiceDuring her session at the Digital Customer Service Summit 2021, Laurie Bruggenwirth, AVP of Digital Operations at Ascentra Credit Union, discusses their evolution to transform the member experience through OnScreen Voice and other Digital Customer Service (DCS)Â tools. Bruggenwirth shares how how her organization transitioned from a phone-based process to OnScreen audio, eliminating friction. Ascentra provides an easy way for members to simply click and speak with a live human representative. No phone numbers are even offered as members hover over the Contact Us section, keeping that digital connectionâand a good NPS resultâintact.DCS enables credit unions to bring the in-branch experience to websites and mobile apps, making live member interactions simple and easy.
