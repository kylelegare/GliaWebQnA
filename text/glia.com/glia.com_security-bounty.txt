For general information about security at Glia Technologies, please see our main website.âProgram RulesAutomated testing is not permitted.Test only with your own team(s) when investigating bugs, and do not interact with other accounts without the consent of their owners.If you inadvertently cause a privacy violation or disruption (such as accessing account data, service configurations or other confidential information) while investigating an issue, you must disclose this in your report.You must be the first person to report the issue to us. We will review duplicate bugs to see if they provide additional information, but otherwise only reward the first reporter.We award bounties at time of fix, and will keep you posted as we work to resolve them.Contacting anyone in the organization outside of bounty-hunters@glia.atlassian.net will result in an immediate disqualification for a bounty for that report.We will endeavour to investigate and respond to all valid reports. We prioritise evaluations based on risk and multiple other factors, and it may take some time before you receive a reply.Do not disclose the issue to the public or a third-party for at least 30 days. In some cases we may request an extension of this period to up to 180 daysBug Bounty RewardsThe following guidelines give you an idea of what we usually pay out for different classes of bugs. Low-quality reports may be rewarded below these tiers, so please make sure that there is enough information for us to be able to reproduce your issue. Step-by-step instructions including how to reproduce are preferred. Screenshots and videos are also helpful, but please make sure to not make these public before submitting them to follow our programâs rules.There is no maximum reward - particularly creative or severe bugs will be rewarded accordingly.
