solution2:28DCS, Glia Virtual Assistants, and Q2According to consumer research done by Rival Technologies, 53% of Gen Z and 42% of Millennials want to be able to find their answers entirely online. So, why is it that so much of customer service is still over the phone? As the new generations of banking customers and credit union members shift overall service preferences, savvy businesses need to learn to adapt to these ever-changing demands.Â At the Conversational Banking Summit 2021 hosted by Finn AI (now a part of Glia), Greg Varnell from Q2 and our own John Fernandez discussed how the digital experience has evolved for banks and credit unions. Hear them talk about how customer and member expectations have changed, what strategies they deploy to serve users in online spaces, and how virtual assistants can be used to greatly improve Digital Customer Service offerings.Learn more about AI-powered banking chatbots from Glia.Glia + Q2What Jim is Reading and Listening To Right NowUltimate Guide to CoBrowsingJimâs Favorite New Product Outside of WorkAmazon EchoLatest VideosA Perfect Match: Digital Customer Service and the Call CenterDigital Customer Service for BanksGlia Call CenterReinventing Customer ServiceHomeCompanyBlogPartnersCareersDEIResourcesDCS Summit PlatformsChannelLessCoBrowsingAI ManagementVideo ChatChatSMSServicesCustomer SuccessSecurityGlia SecurityBounty ProgramSolutionsIncrease SalesModernize SupportCustomer ExperienceDigital-CentricPhone-CentricHome AgentsVideo BankingÂ© Glia Technologies, Inc.
