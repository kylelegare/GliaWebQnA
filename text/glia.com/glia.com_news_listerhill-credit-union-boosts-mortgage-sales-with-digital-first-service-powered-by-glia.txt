The digital-first solution has enabled the Alabama-based credit union to get proactive with sales, fueling significant new growth for its mortgage business.Â Â Gliaâs online collaboration tools, such as CoBrowsing, enable Listerhill to guide members and teach them self-service options that can save members time. Efficiencies from Gliaâs digital-first interaction platform have resulted in a 67% phone call deflection rate while achieving a 4.75/5 member satisfaction score.Â âAt Listerhill, we pride ourselves on our high-touch service and strong member relationships, supporting more than 92,000 members across five states,â said Dustin Holland, Digital Strategist with Listerhill. âLeaning into our core values to exceed expectations and proactively seek improvement, Glia has enabled us to provide online service that mirrors our personalized, in-branch experience, allowing members to feel connected as a part of the Listerhill community regardless of communication channels.âÂ Listerhill Lands More MortgagesIn addition to enhancing member support, Listerhill has leveraged its digital-first service to generate new business. The credit union has experienced steady demand for mortgage lending fueled by strong regional growth. With the ability to guide members online to complete mortgage applications, Listerhill has taken a hands-on approach to helping those members seeking a mortgage. Glia helps Listerhillâs team understand when to proactively engage and offer mortgage guidance by showing where a member is along their journey and where they may be struggling. This direct approach has led to a conversion rate that is four times the industry average, adding an additional $2 million in mortgage sales in the first year. This same principle can streamline other processes, such as loans or credit card applications, where a proactive service experience can increase the conversion rate.âBy seeing who is actively reviewing mortgage information on our site, Iâm able to connect and offer assistance that can help move a member closer to applying for a mortgage with Listerhill, without bothering members who are looking for other services,â said Angela Underwood, Mortgage Originator Specialist with Listerhill. âItâs a high-touch sales process that aligns to Listerhillsâ focus on great member experiences.âÂ To learn more about Listerhill Credit Union and its digital-first strategy, read the Listerhill Case Study.Â About GliaGlia is reinventing how businesses support their customers in a digital world.
