This round was led by existing investor Insight Partners and Glia was advised in the transaction by Cooley LLP.Glia grew by more than 150% in 2020 as the pandemic forced businesses to reimagine how they guide and connect with customers in a digital world. The investment will allow Glia to meet the mounting demand for Digital Customer Service, scaling the category that it helped define. Glia plans to expand every department across its organization, with a focus on product development. In addition, the company is exploring strategic acquisitions.âWe are proud to expand our investment in Glia as the company continues to lead the evolution of Digital Customer Service for enterprises globally,â said Lonne Jaffe, managing director at Insight Partners. âGliaâs platform including CoBrowsing, video chat, and in-app messaging, provides the modern technology necessary for businesses to meet customers in their digital journeys and communicate through the customerâs channel of choice. With this capital, the company will continue to scale and keep up with skyrocketing demand.âDon Brown, a pioneer in the customer service space, also invested in Gliaâs Series C. Brown was the founder and CEO of Interactive Intelligence, which was acquired by Genesys in 2016 for $1.4 billion. Brown commented, âMany companies are still focused on moving antiquated, on-premises telephony systems to cloud contact centers that essentially offer the same functionality. Instead, businesses can leapfrog this process and move directly to a digital-first cloud approach by partnering with Glia. If I were to build Interactive Intelligence for todayâs contact center, I would take Gliaâs approach.ââJust as Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) has transformed the way consumers communicate with colleagues, family, and friends, Digital Customer Service is changing the way businesses support and engage with customers. This is an area that has gone mainstream, as evidenced by Facebookâs (NASDAQ: FB) recent billion-dollar acquisition of Kustomer,â said Dan Michaeli, co-founder and CEO at Glia. âThis capital will allow us to maintain our current momentum, helping businesses across the globe adopt the digital-first approach to customer service necessary to compete and build customer loyalty. Digital Customer Service is the future, and the future is here.âAbout Glia âGlia is reinventing how businesses support their customers in a digital world.
