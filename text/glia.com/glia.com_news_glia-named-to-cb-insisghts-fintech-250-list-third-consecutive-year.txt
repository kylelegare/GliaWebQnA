The distinction showcases the 250 most promising private fintech companies of 2022. Glia is among a smaller group of 159 Fintech 250 companies that have achieved a $1B+ valuation.Â âIn uncertain economic times, the customer experience is more important than ever to build deeper relationships and retain business. Today that requires a digital-first approach. Glia is trailblazing how financial institutions connect with their customers on screen with our ChannelLessâ¢ Digital Customer Service (DCS) platform that fuels client success. We are honored by the growing number of financial institutions adopting our DCS solution and the continued recognition by CB Insights on the Fintech 250 list,â said Jeremy Smith, Chief Operating Officer, Glia.Â Gliaâs strong momentum has continued through 2022, including the acquisition of Finn AIâthe premier AI-powered chatbot platform for banks and credit unionsâand a round of financing that brings Gliaâs total funding to $152M with a valuation that exceeds $1B. Glia continues to grow, exceeding 300 insurance, banking and credit union clients and expanding into the Latin American market.Â Â Collectively, the Fintech 250 cohort raised over $51B in 2021, pushing the total raised since the start of 2017 up to more than $115B. Gliaâs funding rounds in both 2021 and 2022 have contributed to that number. Glia is now among the unicorns on the Fintech 250 list, with a valuation exceeding $1B.Â "This yearâs Fintech 250 winners are shaping the future of financial services, from payments and banking to investing and insurance,â said Brian Lee, SVP of CB Insightsâ Intelligence Unit. âRepresenting more than 30 countries, these companies are creating safer and more efficient payment methods, and transforming how traditional banking, insurance and investing products are delivered. Together, they not only make financial services more convenient for users, but also make them available to more people, especially traditionally underserved populations around the globe.âUtilizing the CB Insights platform, the research team selected these 250 winners from a pool of over 12,500 private companies, including applicants and nominees. They were chosen based on factors including R&D activity, proprietary Mosaic scores, market potential, business relationships, investor profile, news sentiment analysis, competitive landscape, team strength, and tech novelty.
