They identified that their clientâs main competitive advantage was its superior in-person customer service. They wondered, âHow can we replicate that same, winning experience online?â And so Glia was born. They set out to build a unified Digital Customer Service platform from the ground up, with funding from supportive, tech-savvy investors. The result is a patented, visionary approach to Digital Customer Service that has earned many industry awards and praise from customers and analysts alike.âCustomer service technology is our passion, but customer service is in our DNA.
