They increasingly expect the same from the businesses and organizations they deal with, but companies have been slow to respond to these shifting consumer preferences.That is not to say that businesses are blind to this fact. They may make noble efforts to provide varying forms of multi-channel support, but all too often these result in disconnected, bolt-on, point solutions instead of optimized and unified parts of a holistic customer service strategy. Unfortunately, customer satisfaction results frequently reflect that.In this age of consumer choice, customers control the conversation, and products and services have become increasingly commoditized. Customer service has become the differentiator that can make or break a business. A recent Northridge Group study shows a staggering72% of survey participants would switch to a competitor after just one bad experience.Causes of Customer DisloyaltyRepeating InformationTransfersBeing Treated GenerallyRepeat ContactsSwitching Channels3Why Offer Digital Customer Service NOW vs. Later?In The Effortless Experience, authors studied more than 125,000 customers and thousands of service reps to see what makes customers loyal.They concluded that the most significant predictor of disloyalty is the degree of customer effort required.Benefits of Digital Customer ServiceDigital Customer Service reduces customer effort by addressing many typical customer experience (CX) pain points.
