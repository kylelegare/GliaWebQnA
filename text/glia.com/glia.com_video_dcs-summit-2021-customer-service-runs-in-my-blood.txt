The desire to speak with a live human during a moment of truth is 7 times higher, showing the importance of a clear escalation path for customers in a digital journey. To validate that, she noted that the Net Promoter Score (NPS) takes aÂ 58% hit when a customer is forced to dial a phone number from within a digital channel. She also pointed out how companies often focus on the automation side of DCS, often overlooking the communications and collaboration piece of the equation.Digital Customer Service (DCS) is a solution that enriches customer touch points on web, mobile or phone calls with: communication choices (from messaging to video chat), OnScreen collaboration and personalized experiences.
