The deal aims to mainstream virtual assistants for financial services companies by making Finn AIâs proven conversational AI solutions an integral part of Gliaâs industry-leading Digital Customer Service (DCS) platform.Â This unified solution will enable financial institutions to provide customers with a seamless digital experience across both virtual and human assistants, boosting customer satisfaction while driving new operational efficiencies. The unparalleled expertise of Glia and Finn AI, combined with Gliaâs broad scale and industry reach, provide the foundation for delivering the financial industryâs most effective chatbot solution at scale.Â âThis marks a new chapter for Virtual Assistants: Verticalization with Scale. Generic âone-size-fits-allâ bot providers have largely failed to meet the full potential of conversational AI, leading to the emergence of vendors focusing on specific industry verticals. Until now, none of the financial services bot vendors have been able to achieve widespread adoption on their own,â said Dan Michaeli, co-founder and CEO of Glia.âGliaâs large and rapidly growing customer base, combined with solid financial backing to accelerate the pace of innovation, immediately brings that scale. Finn AI is a strong fit for Glia based on its technology, market approach and company culture. We are thrilled to welcome the Finn AI team to Glia,â Michaeli continued.Â Â It was apparent when Finn AI first launched its banking-focused virtual assistant for Gliaâs DCS platform in 2020 that the two companies shared a vision.âOur vertical approach and tight integration with Glia helps financial institutions reduce the costs, extensive training and development time typically required for general AI platforms. Now as part of Glia, we will have the scale to deliver automation solutions to the market as part of a seamless Digital Customer Service platform that delivers the best of both self-service and human assistance when and where it is most convenient for customers. With our existing integration and satisfied joint customers, we will hit the ground running. This is an exciting next step in our journey and we couldnât be happier to be a part of Gliaâ said Jake Tyler, co-founder and CEO of Finn AI.Â Glia will maintain and expand the presence in the Finn AI Canada office, establishing a âConversational AI Center of Excellence.â The strong presence in Canada aligns with Gliaâs global expansion strategy. The Finn AI leadership team will assume leadership positions within Glia to further develop AI automation and virtual assistant solutions for the Glia DCS platform.About Finn AIFounded in 2014, Finn AI is the leading AI-powered virtual assistant platform for banks and credit unions.
