Members can now transition seamlessly between chat, OnScreen voice and video, with online collaboration tools, including CoBrowsing, bringing Dover Federalâs âlegendary serviceâ to the digital realm.Â The efficiencies of the Glia platform have resulted in an ongoing decrease in both the Average Handle Time, down 21% and falling, as well as the Average Wait Time which has dropped 40% to date. This has allowed the Dover Federal member services team to handle a 13% increase in engagements despite havingÂ  fewer staff members. Glia is popular with the service team, providing the tools they need to become strategic guides in helping members online.Â âGlia reshaped how we do business with its 100% digital-first approach. We reimagined everything and completely changed how we engage with our members. This allows us to leverage technology and be leading in our industry,â said Tyler Kuhn, ChiefÂ  Marketing and Digital Experience for Dover Federal Credit Union.Â All-In with DCSBased on the successful results across all digital channels with Glia, Dover Federal deployed Glia Phone to become 100% digital-first. The entire contact center, including the telephone system, is now part of the Glia platform. Even traditional telephone calls are now digital engagements, creating a single source of member data. This makes management, reporting and even staffing easier.âBy going âall-inâ with Gliaâs Digital Customer Service platformâincluding Glia PhoneâDover Federal Credit Union is a powerful example of the value a truly digital-first approach provides. Members are experiencing faster, better services across all channels and employee satisfaction is high,â said Dan Michaeli, Co-Founder and CEO of Glia.Â To learn more about Dover Federal Credit Union and its 100% digital-first approach, read the Dover Federal Case Study.âAbout GliaGlia is reinventing how businesses support their customers in a digital world.
