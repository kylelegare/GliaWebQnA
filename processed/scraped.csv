They increasingly expect the same from the businesses and organizations they deal with, but companies have been slow to respond to these shifting consumer preferences.That is not to say that businesses are blind to this fact. They may make noble efforts to provide varying forms of multi-channel support, but all too often these result in disconnected, bolt-on, point solutions instead of optimized and unified parts of a holistic customer service strategy. Unfortunately, customer satisfaction results frequently reflect that.In this age of consumer choice, customers control the conversation, and products and services have become increasingly commoditized. Customer service has become the differentiator that can make or break a business. A recent Northridge Group study shows a staggering72% of survey participants would switch to a competitor after just one bad experience.Causes of Customer DisloyaltyRepeating InformationTransfersBeing Treated GenerallyRepeat ContactsSwitching Channels3Why Offer Digital Customer Service NOW vs. Later?In The Effortless Experience, authors studied more than 125,000 customers and thousands of service reps to see what makes customers loyal.They concluded that the most significant predictor of disloyalty is the degree of customer effort required.Benefits of Digital Customer ServiceDigital Customer Service reduces customer effort by addressing many typical customer experience (CX) pain points. It is not unusual to see 20% improvements in customer satisfaction, reflected in NPS and CSAT scores.DCS provides agents with the means and data to be more effective in resolving customer inquiries, lowering Average Handle Times by 18%.Helping customers online in their channels of choice and offering contextual on- and off-screen guidance can increase conversion by 4x or more.4Why Glia Digital Customer Service Technology?Glia provides digital-first customer service technology that is reinventing how businesses support their customers online.

This round was led by existing investor Insight Partners and Glia was advised in the transaction by Cooley LLP.Glia grew by more than 150% in 2020 as the pandemic forced businesses to reimagine how they guide and connect with customers in a digital world. The investment will allow Glia to meet the mounting demand for Digital Customer Service, scaling the category that it helped define. Glia plans to expand every department across its organization, with a focus on product development. In addition, the company is exploring strategic acquisitions.âWe are proud to expand our investment in Glia as the company continues to lead the evolution of Digital Customer Service for enterprises globally,â said Lonne Jaffe, managing director at Insight Partners. âGliaâs platform including CoBrowsing, video chat, and in-app messaging, provides the modern technology necessary for businesses to meet customers in their digital journeys and communicate through the customerâs channel of choice. With this capital, the company will continue to scale and keep up with skyrocketing demand.âDon Brown, a pioneer in the customer service space, also invested in Gliaâs Series C. Brown was the founder and CEO of Interactive Intelligence, which was acquired by Genesys in 2016 for $1.4 billion. Brown commented, âMany companies are still focused on moving antiquated, on-premises telephony systems to cloud contact centers that essentially offer the same functionality. Instead, businesses can leapfrog this process and move directly to a digital-first cloud approach by partnering with Glia. If I were to build Interactive Intelligence for todayâs contact center, I would take Gliaâs approach.ââJust as Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) has transformed the way consumers communicate with colleagues, family, and friends, Digital Customer Service is changing the way businesses support and engage with customers. This is an area that has gone mainstream, as evidenced by Facebookâs (NASDAQ: FB) recent billion-dollar acquisition of Kustomer,â said Dan Michaeli, co-founder and CEO at Glia. âThis capital will allow us to maintain our current momentum, helping businesses across the globe adopt the digital-first approach to customer service necessary to compete and build customer loyalty.

Most consumers have access to a mobile device with text messaging. For many (like a majority of millennials) texting is the communication channel of choice. So why not interact with your customers where they are most comfortable?Texts Get NoticedInbound SMS is a must today, but if you're not using outbound SMS in your customer support, loyalty and promotional efforts you're missing out. Recent statistics show that 98% of texts are opened and 90% are acted upon within three minutes. Imagine what that could mean for how you reach your customers and prospects.A World of PossibilitiesIntegrate outbound SMS text alerts with your business applications and marketing technology to power everything from proactive text alerts for security and account-related events to interactive contextual offers on a scheduled or triggered basis.So Much More Than Just TextingGlia's SMS Gateway enables you to achieve a new level of customer communications. Reach your customers in the palm of their hands and delight them with interactive engagements. Provide them the opportunity to seamlessly switch to even richer media such as voice or video with cobrowsing with just one tap.See The VideoSee The VideoImprove customer communications with SMS.Turn Outbound SMS into Two-Way ConversationsEnsure the âImportant Stuffâ is Noticed via Proactive AlertsYou canât count on customers seeing an email or answering a call, but they do read and interact with texts. Send outbound SMS notifications on a scheduled basis (like a pending renewal) or by a triggered event such as unusual account activity. Clients can respond to text alerts when it's most convenient and interact with a chatbot powered by Glia's AIÂ Management, or with one of your operators to quickly process transactions or resolve issues.Energize Your Marketing Campaigns with SMS Prospects and customers often shy away from unsolicited calls. Intrusive forms that are acted upon AFTER the visitor has forgotten you arenât any better. These channels can limit your campaign effectiveness. Sending a promotional text to a valued customer, or inviting pay-per-click prospects to text you while the offer is still relevant, can make the difference between mediocrity and success.Give Callers a Better Alternative to âPlease HoldâNobody likes being stuck waiting to speak to a representative, but callbacks aren't always a practical solution. Phone-to-Text allows you to reduce friction and enhance the customer experience by giving callers the choice to opt-out in the IVR and seamlessly switch to SMS. Engagement can be automated by an intelligent Virtual Assistant or handled by your operators for the customized experience your clients desire.Gateway to a Seamless Digital First ExperienceLike every interaction within the Glia Digital First platform, your end-users can seamlessly switch from SMS to other channels like voice, video chat, and co-browsing without losing connection or context. Plus all interactions are securely tracked in the interaction database to ensure quality control and compliance.This is how it worksExplore the use casesSend Timely NotificationsSee also:Convert Phone Calls into Text ConversationsReinvent How You Serve Your CustomersRequest a DemoâWith Glia we increased our conversion by over 200%âDirector of Digital - Top 10 BankReinventing Customer ServiceHomeCompanyBlogPartnersCareersDEIResourcesDCS Summit PlatformsChannelLessCoBrowsingAI ManagementVideo ChatChatSMSServicesCustomer SuccessSecurityGlia SecurityBounty ProgramSolutionsIncrease SalesModernize SupportCustomer ExperienceDigital-CentricPhone-CentricHome AgentsVideo BankingÂ© Glia Technologies, Inc.

Most consumers have access to a mobile device with text messaging. For many (like a majority of millennials) texting is the communication channel of choice. So why not interact with your customers where they are most comfortable?Texts Get NoticedInbound SMS is a must today, but if you're not using outbound SMS in your customer support, loyalty and promotional efforts you're missing out. Recent statistics show that 98% of texts are opened and 90% are acted upon within three minutes. Imagine what that could mean for how you reach your customers and prospects.A World of PossibilitiesIntegrate outbound SMS text alerts with your business applications and marketing technology to power everything from proactive text alerts for security and account-related events to interactive contextual offers on a scheduled or triggered basis.So Much More Than Just TextingGlia's SMS Gateway enables you to achieve a new level of customer communications. Reach your customers in the palm of their hands and delight them with interactive engagements. Provide them the opportunity to seamlessly switch to even richer media such as voice or video with cobrowsing with just one tap.See The VideoSee The VideoImprove customer communications with SMS.Turn Outbound SMS into Two-Way ConversationsEnsure the âImportant Stuffâ is Noticed via Proactive AlertsYou canât count on customers seeing an email or answering a call, but they do read and interact with texts. Send outbound SMS notifications on a scheduled basis (like a pending renewal) or by a triggered event such as unusual account activity. Clients can respond to text alerts when it's most convenient and interact with a chatbot powered by Glia's AIÂ Management, or with one of your operators to quickly process transactions or resolve issues.Energize Your Marketing Campaigns with SMS Prospects and customers often shy away from unsolicited calls. Intrusive forms that are acted upon AFTER the visitor has forgotten you arenât any better. These channels can limit your campaign effectiveness. Sending a promotional text to a valued customer, or inviting pay-per-click prospects to text you while the offer is still relevant, can make the difference between mediocrity and success.Give Callers a Better Alternative to âPlease HoldâNobody likes being stuck waiting to speak to a representative, but callbacks aren't always a practical solution. Phone-to-Text allows you to reduce friction and enhance the customer experience by giving callers the choice to opt-out in the IVR and seamlessly switch to SMS. Engagement can be automated by an intelligent Virtual Assistant or handled by your operators for the customized experience your clients desire.Gateway to a Seamless Digital First ExperienceLike every interaction within the Glia Digital First platform, your end-users can seamlessly switch from SMS to other channels like voice, video chat, and co-browsing without losing connection or context.

Your agents and customers will thank you!Benefits of Glia AppletsAccess all agent applications from one unified interfaceScreen pop the information agents need, when they need itDo away with copy and paste madness and Post-it notesWhy Applets?Ubiquitous Visitor InformationGliaâs secure digital-first communications platform seamlessly shares all visit-related information between every point in an interaction with intelligent screen pops, so visitors never have to repeat themselves. Applets enable third-party applications to utilize the same information within a single unified interface.Application Switching Wastes Time and MoneyResearch from analysts like Aberdeen shows the average contact center agent switches between three to five applications during an interaction. That wastes up to 26% of their time which adds up to lower productivity, higher costs and less satisfying interactions for customers.Adding New Applets is EasyGlia enables simple integration of third-party applications into the Operator interface via an easy-to-use SDK. Since Applets use standard web development languages like JavaScript and HTML, beyond securely sharing data between Glia and your applications, you can implement any other necessary logic to satisfy your needs.Customized Views to Fit Agent StylesGlia provides a single, unified desktop view of agent applications in a tabbed interface, but also provides different display modes to accommodate representatives' styles and workspace. Tabs can be expanded, minimized to simplify co-browsing, or popped out and moved around as needed. Agentsâ view preferences persist across sessions.Quick Access to Applications and InformationWhen operators engage with customers, they need information that is managed in other applications like CRMs and proprietary software. Instead of manually opening these applications and then searching for relevant pieces of information, Glia applets do this automatically for the operator. Each Applet runs within the Glia Hub and allows data to be exchanged with any external applications and presented to CSRs in a clean unified manner, when they need it, right at their fingertips.Make Life Easier For Reps ... and CustomersA customer service representative (CSR) that doesnât have to waste countless time constantly jumping between programs to copy and paste information, and/or transcribing sticky notes, is generally happier and more effective. Glia Applets' unified interface eliminates those issues and improves accuracy so CSRs can focus on the client, instead of their desktop, which translates to happier customers too.Interoperability is at the Heart of GliaGlia was born out of a desire to bring world-class in-person customer experiences to all interactions. Every part of the Glia platform is part of a seamless whole. Applets are one way of extending that philosophy to integrate your business applications into the Operator interface. Similarly, you can harmoniously integrate and embed Glia into your own customer-facing web and mobile apps.Reinvent How You Serve Your CustomersRequest a DemoâWith Glia we increased our conversion by over 200%âDirector of Digital - Top 10 BankReinventing Customer ServiceHomeCompanyBlogPartnersCareersDEIResourcesDCS Summit PlatformsChannelLessCoBrowsingAI ManagementVideo ChatChatSMSServicesCustomer SuccessSecurityGlia SecurityBounty ProgramSolutionsIncrease SalesModernize SupportCustomer ExperienceDigital-CentricPhone-CentricHome AgentsVideo BankingÂ© Glia Technologies, Inc.

Â Delays in performing obligations due to a Force Majeure Event shall automatically extend the deadline for performing such obligations for a period equal to the duration of such Force Majeure Event. Â Except as otherwise agreed upon by the Parties in writing, in the event such non-performance continues for a period of thirty (30) days or more, either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to the other Party. Â Upon the occurrence of any Force Majeure Event, the affected Party shall give the other Party written notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable of its failure of performance, describing the cause and effect of such failure, and the anticipated duration of its inability to perform. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

Would you like me to walk you through?Hi! Yes please!Why Video Banking?Provide the Next Best Thing to In-Person ServiceSee The VideoSee The VideoPeople still like the reassurance of face-to-face interactions with their chosen community banks or credit unions when it comes to matters of finance. However, in-person interactions are not always possible or practical because of incompatible schedules, lack of transportation, specialist availability, or (most recently) social distancing. That doesnât mean you can't provide the benefits of face-to-face assistance from a smiling, knowledgable representative anyway. Whether consumers are sitting in a branch talking to an on-screen remote specialist, or are across town video-chatting on their PCs or phones, one- or two-way Video Banking enables repreentatives in a branch, call center, or home office to serve them at home, work, or on-the-go as if everybody was in the same room.Seeing each other during a remote interaction promotes trust and confidence for consumers, and helps reps gauge customer comprehension, emotional state, and satisfaction!Reasons to Include Video Banking in Your Service OperationsBuild RelationshipsPeople like in-person assistance when it comes to finances. Video builds long-term customer rapport. Instill TrustA smiling face can put consumers at ease and help them feel more comfortable during a transaction.ConvenienceProvide a friendly, branch-like experience wherever it's needed â at home, work, or on-the-go.ClarityVideo combined with on-screen collaboration removes ambiguity as if being in the same room.Expert AvailabilityOnline or in-branch, connect consumers with the right remote specialists to achieve their financial goals.Shared ResourcesLet your experts provide face-to-face help across multiple branches and your online communities.Why DCS and Video BankingNext-Generation Video Banking applies a full suite of Digital Customer Service technologies to remote banking to deliver unparalleled experiences for customers and the agents and bankers serving them.

They identified that their clientâs main competitive advantage was its superior in-person customer service.

We've got your answers below.GeneralApplyingEngineeringFAQs: Applying and InterviewingWe want you to have the simplest, easiest buying experience possible. But we know you might have a few questions. Read on for details about purchasing, shipping, checking order status, returns, and more.Generalâ¢ What Does Glia Doâ¢ When Was Glia Foundedâ¢ What is Gliaâs work culture like?â¢ What are the office locations?â¢ How does the time difference between your locations affect workflows?â¢ Do I need to be at the office or can I work remotely?Read more....Applyingâ¢ There aren't any roles open for me on the careers page. What can I do?When Was Glia FoundedWhat is Gliaâs work culture like?What are the office locations?How does the time difference between your locations affect workflows?EngineeringWhat Does Glia DoWhen Was Glia FoundedWhat is Gliaâs work culture like?What are the office locations?How does the time difference between your locations affect workflows?GeneralWhat does Glia do?Gliaâs Digital Customer Service solution brings the in-person experience to digital customer interactions - whether they start online or on the phone.When was Glia founded?âGliaâs journey began in 2011 when two of our founders, Dan and Justin, were growth consultants for a Fortune 50 retailer. They identified that their clientâs main competitive advantage was its superior in-person customer service. They wondered, âHow can we replicate that same, winning experience online?â And so Glia was born.They set out to build a unified Digital Customer Service platform from the ground up (with the tech expertise of co-founder Carlos and the support of tech-savvy investors). The result is a patented, visionary approach to Digital Customer Service. Itâs earned many industry awards and praise from customers and analysts alike and is fueling company growth.What is Gliaâs work culture like?Glianeers raise the bar. Weâre driven, communicate openly, and support each other (and our clients) fiercely. We hold ourselves to high standards and strong values, including the core values we call CChaMP.Â CollaborateChallengeMasterPersevereThose values and guiding principles are exemplified in every aspect of Glia from how we interact to how we build our technology.What are the office locations?We have offices in New York, USA, Tallinn, Estonia, Tartu, Estonia and Vancouver, Canada. In practice, these are resource centers where Glianeers can work from depending on their FlexWork choice.How does the time difference between your locations affect workflows?The biggest factor in succeeding with our spread out team is asynchronous, open, and clear communication. Otherwise, planning ahead to accommodate availability across time zones allows everyone to work more closely when meetings are necessary.A weekly company-wide check-in helps everyone feel connected, get a chance to see each other, and find out what other teams are working on. Itâs one of those meetings where everyone is marked optional, but if it were in-person, it would be standing room only.Do I need to be at the office or can I work remotely?Weâve learned that doing oneâs best work can look very different from one person to the next. Whether you love being able to jump into a room for a brainstorming session with teammates on a whim or the freedom of taking a cleaning break while working from homeâor even bothâweâve got options for you.Â Â We have an official policy called FlexWork. You find the option that fits best and we make it work for you.How international is your team?At last count, Glianeers represent 15 nationalities and speak 18 different languages (although a few are more likely to be heard on the screen or at a Comic-Con convention than at a diplomatic relations meeting).Weâre proud of our diverse team, so those numbers are likely to date quickly.Who are Gliaâs clients?Our clients are the biggest names in the Financial Services market â for example credit unions, banks, insurance companies, and financial advisor organizations. View case studies and testimonials from some of our clients.What are the perks and benefits?When youâre a Glianeer you can expect:Medical insurance plans*Pension and retirement plans*Generous Paid Time Off (PTO) / leave policy*Stock optionsGym membership supportFlexWork modelSocial eventsSnacks and refreshments**Office set-up**Relocation supportParental leavePersonal developmentÂ * Varies depending on location** Varies depending on FlexWork optionDo I get stock?We want all Glianeers to own their success, so stock options are part of our compensation package. Glia could be applied to any business, why focus on financial services?Everyone starts somewhere and it takes focus to really get things right. Finance is the sector weâve focused on to really learn our craft and refine our products. Weâre not worried about doing it all, weâre zeroed-in on doing it best first.What are your work hours?Â When do you do your best work? When are you most effective with your team? Then thatâs when our work hours are.What is the interview process like?After you apply for your perfect role on our careers page one of our awesome talent operations team members will be in touchâexpect communication regardless of whether we decide to move forward in the hiring process.Our process ensures that you get a real feel for Glia, our products, and the incredible people youâll be working with. Youâll meet with your potential team members and people from other departments and locations. Expect an opportunity to show off what youâre great at.Otherwise start thinking about whether youâre working from home, one of our office hubs, or a bit of both.ApplyingThere aren't any roles open for me on the careers page. What can I do?You love our mission, our products, our people. We hear you! Set your mission as a Glianeer and tell us what that looks like!Â Does Glia have internship programs?We periodically take interns for experiences in a variety of departments. Keep an eye on our careers page and social media channels to stay in the know.Who should I address my cover letter to?Our talent operations team.How can I prepare for an interview at Glia?A new position in any company is a big commitment â youâre offering your talents, knowledge, skillset, and time. We want to make sure youâre doing that with a company and mission you can really get behindâand hopefully thatâs Glia.The best way to start is learning about usâon our website, our blog, and social media channels like LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.Once you know a bit more about us, weâre sure youâll be able to tell us about how you see yourself developing the role youâre interested inâand beyond.Where can I get answers to any other questions about Gliaâs hiring process?Canât find the info in the job posting or here? Get in touch.EngineeringWhat technologies are you using?Back-end and full-stack developers at Glia can expect to work on building a cloud native, highly distributed system written in Elixir (backed by Postgres and NoSQL stores, like Redis and S3). Services run as containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. All of it is on AWS and defined in code (e.g. Ansible). As such, Linux/Unix tools and ecosystem are part of the package.For front-end engineers, the stack includes an JS API written in JS ES6 and Web applications written in React.Our mobile developers collaborate with other engineers to develop and maintain native SDK. Android engineers function with Java, while iOS developers do so with Swift. A few tools for observability and telemetry include ZipKin (open tracing) and an ELK stack to increase confidence in our continuous delivery process.Â Do you plan to change your tech stack in the future?Weâve done so in the past, but donât have any planned stack changes on the horizon.Â What is the size and structure of the engineering team?Â Over the years, weâve experimented with team setup and shaped an approach that is poised to serve us well as we continue scaling. Today, we build new teams by expanding one team and then dividing it. This engineering team mitosis allows for growth that provides initial structure and support to new Glianeers while ensuring continuity of technical and cultural standards. If we find that two teams are starting to overlap in their responsibilities, we designate that area of responsibility to one of the teams, freeing up the other to shift their focus.Some teams focus on whoâs being served by the product. For example, one teamâs focus may be on the end-user (our clientâs customer), while another teamâs North Star is the customer service agent for whom Gliaâs technology is mission-critical. Other teams are organized around operational management or analyzing business metricsâproviding our clients with a full range of Glia products.Of course, we wouldnât function without our platform teams. They build the infrastructure to enable all the development and keep everything running smoothly. Meanwhile our Information Security and Compliance Team makes sure that our platform is secured and our customersâ data is protected. Read more about the Glia Engineering team.How is the current team going to change during the next few months?As a company weâre growing rapidly, but mindfully. We prioritize the quality of growth over the quantity. This will translate to new faces in meetings, but youâll always have someone as the resource on any product and process questions.Â Will there be a possibility to become a team lead/manager?Wow! Youâre really looking for long-term prospects with Glia. We love it!Our engineering career development moves along two distinct tracksâTechnical and Management. The management track spans from an Engineering Manager role to Senior EM, up to leadership positions such as Director and VP. On the technical track, engineers can hone their skills and grow beyond senior positions into Staff and Tech Lead roles.Technical Track: Our Staff Engineers serve as roving Glia-engineering experts. Their in-depth specialization, whether technical or organizational, allows them to lend their support and know-how to the teams as needed.Management Track: The Engineering Manager role, while requiring an understanding of software creation, is a people role. Partnered with a Tech Lead, the two roles are focused on the two drivers of engineering team successâthe people and the tech. The work is a partnership, but the responsibilities are clearly defined.I donât have experience with Ruby/Elixir. Will that be a problem?Short answer â no.Slightly longer answer: While Ruby and Elixir are key languages we use, not all new Glianeers need to be fluent in them. Weâve designed structures for learning, from courses to consistent support from Engineering Managers. Glianeers are the ones who decide the best approach to learning. Check out the experience of one of our Senior Engineers who dove into Elixir.Reinventing Customer ServiceHomeCompanyBlogPartnersCareersDEIResourcesDCS Summit PlatformsChannelLessCoBrowsingAI ManagementVideo ChatChatSMSServicesCustomer SuccessSecurityGlia SecurityBounty ProgramSolutionsIncrease SalesModernize SupportCustomer ExperienceDigital-CentricPhone-CentricHome AgentsVideo BankingÂ© Glia Technologies, Inc.

The distinction showcases the 250 most promising private fintech companies of 2022. Glia is among a smaller group of 159 Fintech 250 companies that have achieved a $1B+ valuation.Â âIn uncertain economic times, the customer experience is more important than ever to build deeper relationships and retain business. Today that requires a digital-first approach. Glia is trailblazing how financial institutions connect with their customers on screen with our ChannelLessâ¢ Digital Customer Service (DCS) platform that fuels client success. We are honored by the growing number of financial institutions adopting our DCS solution and the continued recognition by CB Insights on the Fintech 250 list,â said Jeremy Smith, Chief Operating Officer, Glia.Â Gliaâs strong momentum has continued through 2022, including the acquisition of Finn AIâthe premier AI-powered chatbot platform for banks and credit unionsâand a round of financing that brings Gliaâs total funding to $152M with a valuation that exceeds $1B. Glia continues to grow, exceeding 300 insurance, banking and credit union clients and expanding into the Latin American market.Â Â Collectively, the Fintech 250 cohort raised over $51B in 2021, pushing the total raised since the start of 2017 up to more than $115B. Gliaâs funding rounds in both 2021 and 2022 have contributed to that number. Glia is now among the unicorns on the Fintech 250 list, with a valuation exceeding $1B.Â ""This yearâs Fintech 250 winners are shaping the future of financial services, from payments and banking to investing and insurance,â said Brian Lee, SVP of CB Insightsâ Intelligence Unit. âRepresenting more than 30 countries, these companies are creating safer and more efficient payment methods, and transforming how traditional banking, insurance and investing products are delivered. Together, they not only make financial services more convenient for users, but also make them available to more people, especially traditionally underserved populations around the globe.âUtilizing the CB Insights platform, the research team selected these 250 winners from a pool of over 12,500 private companies, including applicants and nominees. They were chosen based on factors including R&D activity, proprietary Mosaic scores, market potential, business relationships, investor profile, news sentiment analysis, competitive landscape, team strength, and tech novelty.

Glia Call Center is the first customer experience suite designed specifically for the financial services industry.Â The new release incorporates rich conversational AI features for automating phone interactions and deep integration with leading fintech providers, while facilitating financial institutionsâ migration from phone-centric to digital-first customer service.Â Â âWhile customer service preferences are rapidly shifting to digital channels, traditional calls still represent a healthy portion of interactions. Managing this shifting interaction mix is a challenge for financial institutions, typically requiring two or more systems to staff customer service needs. Glia Call Center enables financial institutions to marry phone calls and digital experiences together, for a single, unified approach as part of our ChannelLess Interaction Platform,â said Justin DiPietro, Chief Strategy Officer for Glia.Glia Call Center creates efficiencies in management, staffing and reporting. In addition to new conversational AI capabilities and fintech integrations, enhancements include a richer phone and supervisory feature set, along with enhanced reporting and dashboard capabilities.Over 20 percent of Gliaâs clients, including major financial institutions, are already using Glia Call Center to bring all interactions together within the Glia Interaction Platform. They are achieving greater efficiencies while improving the overall customer experience, as seen in reduced handle times and improved customer satisfaction scores.Â âWith Glia Call Center, weâve brought traditional phone and digital interactions together on a single platform, which is driving new efficiencies. Weâve streamlined planning, reporting and staffing. As a result, the employee experience has greatly improved through bringing our phone and digital teams together, which in turn delivers an optimal member experience,â said Todd Wilson, VP of Member Experience for Dover Federal Credit Union.Â âWe deployed Glia Call Center to manage the substantial increase over the past few years in both phone calls and digital interactions, which were managed by two separate systems. By consolidating phone calls and digital interactions within the Glia Interaction Platform, we now provide a seamless member experience across all channels. The overall efficiency weâve achieved with Glia Call Center has increased production while maintaining a high level of employee satisfaction and improved member engagement,â said Laurie Bruggenwirth, AVP of Digital Operations for Ascentra Credit Union.Beyond Omnichannel for a ChannelLess ExperienceGlia Call Center overcomes the common silos between phone and digital channels that exist even on omnichannel platforms. Gliaâs ChannelLess architecture is free of channel limitations, enabling a seamless experience across the entire interaction where conversations can easily transition from one channel to another. Glia Call Center brings traditional calls into Gliaâs ChannelLess Interaction Platform to connect dial-in phone, online and mobile experiences. Unifying routing, administration and reporting within Gliaâs single platform creates significant efficiencies while also enabling effortless customer and employee experiences.Streamline Automation On One PlatformWith Glia Call Center, the Glia Interaction Platform now enables a single native conversational AI solution for both text and voice-based automation. A combination of virtual assistants, such as chatbots for digital interactions, and Intelligent Virtual Assistants or IVAs for phone and digital voice interactions can deliver a consistent customer experience for automated guidance. This reduces the complexity of managing separate automation solutions across multiple platforms, leading to cost savings and reduced staffing needs, including AI-based after-hours service.Â For more information, go to www.glia.com/glia-call-center.âAbout GliaGlia is reinventing how businesses support their customers in a digital world.

Both empower service representatives to reach out to customers and easily add richer digital channels, such as chat, OnScreen voice or video, without breaking the connection.âOur customers have been incredibly responsive to SMS, especially our QR code promotions at sporting events and service options at auto dealerships. We are excited to take our texting capabilities to the next level with Gliaâs outbound capabilities, tied directly into our Digital Customer Service platform. We see a significant opportunity to get highly proactive and grow our business,â said Jeff Ward, chief technology officer for SimplyIOA.Â SMS and the ChannelLess AdvantageGliaâs ChannelLess architecture overcomes omnichannel limitations by fully integrating all communications channels, including SMS, onto a single platform. This enables easy transitions from one channel to another and unified administration across the entire customer engagement.Â With Glia, businesses can proactively reach out to customers and launch a seamless engagement that can start with SMS. Customers are not forced to make a phone call to continue service. The entire engagement remains digital, transitioning to chat, OnScreen voice or video for real-time support and can include CoBrowsing for OnScreen collaboration.Â Gliaâs ChannelLess SMS connects customers to the same service representative who texted them through affinity routing. It also includes tools to help service reps further accelerate engagements, including AutoComplete, lightning messages and automation capabilities via AI and chatbots.In addition to a better OnScreen experience, Gliaâs seamless Digital Customer Service platform greatly improves the security of engagements. SMS messages are not encrypted, making them susceptible to data breaches and identity theft. Gliaâs chat, OnScreen voice and video have end-to-end encryption to protect sensitive data.Â Outbound Calling Gets Digital with ChannelLess ApproachBusinesses can now proactively reach customers via telephone and bring them into a fully digital engagement with Gliaâs enhanced ChannelLess calling feature.

The digital-first solution has enabled the Alabama-based credit union to get proactive with sales, fueling significant new growth for its mortgage business.Â Â Gliaâs online collaboration tools, such as CoBrowsing, enable Listerhill to guide members and teach them self-service options that can save members time. Efficiencies from Gliaâs digital-first interaction platform have resulted in a 67% phone call deflection rate while achieving a 4.75/5 member satisfaction score.Â âAt Listerhill, we pride ourselves on our high-touch service and strong member relationships, supporting more than 92,000 members across five states,â said Dustin Holland, Digital Strategist with Listerhill. âLeaning into our core values to exceed expectations and proactively seek improvement, Glia has enabled us to provide online service that mirrors our personalized, in-branch experience, allowing members to feel connected as a part of the Listerhill community regardless of communication channels.âÂ Listerhill Lands More MortgagesIn addition to enhancing member support, Listerhill has leveraged its digital-first service to generate new business. The credit union has experienced steady demand for mortgage lending fueled by strong regional growth. With the ability to guide members online to complete mortgage applications, Listerhill has taken a hands-on approach to helping those members seeking a mortgage. Glia helps Listerhillâs team understand when to proactively engage and offer mortgage guidance by showing where a member is along their journey and where they may be struggling. This direct approach has led to a conversion rate that is four times the industry average, adding an additional $2 million in mortgage sales in the first year. This same principle can streamline other processes, such as loans or credit card applications, where a proactive service experience can increase the conversion rate.âBy seeing who is actively reviewing mortgage information on our site, Iâm able to connect and offer assistance that can help move a member closer to applying for a mortgage with Listerhill, without bothering members who are looking for other services,â said Angela Underwood, Mortgage Originator Specialist with Listerhill. âItâs a high-touch sales process that aligns to Listerhillsâ focus on great member experiences.âÂ To learn more about Listerhill Credit Union and its digital-first strategy, read the Listerhill Case Study.Â About GliaGlia is reinventing how businesses support their customers in a digital world.

The deal aims to mainstream virtual assistants for financial services companies by making Finn AIâs proven conversational AI solutions an integral part of Gliaâs industry-leading Digital Customer Service (DCS) platform.Â This unified solution will enable financial institutions to provide customers with a seamless digital experience across both virtual and human assistants, boosting customer satisfaction while driving new operational efficiencies. The unparalleled expertise of Glia and Finn AI, combined with Gliaâs broad scale and industry reach, provide the foundation for delivering the financial industryâs most effective chatbot solution at scale.Â âThis marks a new chapter for Virtual Assistants: Verticalization with Scale. Generic âone-size-fits-allâ bot providers have largely failed to meet the full potential of conversational AI, leading to the emergence of vendors focusing on specific industry verticals. Until now, none of the financial services bot vendors have been able to achieve widespread adoption on their own,â said Dan Michaeli, co-founder and CEO of Glia.âGliaâs large and rapidly growing customer base, combined with solid financial backing to accelerate the pace of innovation, immediately brings that scale. Finn AI is a strong fit for Glia based on its technology, market approach and company culture. We are thrilled to welcome the Finn AI team to Glia,â Michaeli continued.Â Â It was apparent when Finn AI first launched its banking-focused virtual assistant for Gliaâs DCS platform in 2020 that the two companies shared a vision.âOur vertical approach and tight integration with Glia helps financial institutions reduce the costs, extensive training and development time typically required for general AI platforms. Now as part of Glia, we will have the scale to deliver automation solutions to the market as part of a seamless Digital Customer Service platform that delivers the best of both self-service and human assistance when and where it is most convenient for customers. With our existing integration and satisfied joint customers, we will hit the ground running. This is an exciting next step in our journey and we couldnât be happier to be a part of Gliaâ said Jake Tyler, co-founder and CEO of Finn AI.Â Glia will maintain and expand the presence in the Finn AI Canada office, establishing a âConversational AI Center of Excellence.â The strong presence in Canada aligns with Gliaâs global expansion strategy. The Finn AI leadership team will assume leadership positions within Glia to further develop AI automation and virtual assistant solutions for the Glia DCS platform.About Finn AIFounded in 2014, Finn AI is the leading AI-powered virtual assistant platform for banks and credit unions. Finn AIâs turnkey virtual assistant makes banking easier and more convenient for customers while delivering the operational efficiencies and cost savings of conversational AI. Finn AI has partnered with major FIs including ATB Financial, BECU, United Federal Credit Union, EQ Bank, Civista Bank, Truist Momentum and more.Â  For more information, visit http://www.finn.ai.âAbout GliaGlia is reinventing how businesses support their customers in a digital world.

Built on conversational AI solutions from Gliaâs recent Finn AI acquisition, GVAs are optimized for banks and credit unions and pre-trained to deliver out-of-the-box value. By fully integrating GVAs into its market-leading platform, Glia offers a single provider solution for Digital Customer Service.Â Gliaâs first virtual assistants, developed specifically for digital banking, are integrated with leading online banking platforms and require no AI training to get started. Equipped to handle 800+ digital banking scenarios right out of the box, they eliminate the need for ramp-up time. GVAs continue to learn, adapt and improve over time, trained on collective (and anonymized) engagements across Gliaâs GVA client base.Â âGlia Virtual Assistants are that rare win-win-win solution, improving efficiency, delivering after-hours support and also enhancing the customer experience. By automating handling of routine service inquiries, live representatives can focus on resolving more complex issues. This reduces costs, accelerates resolution times and boosts customer and employee satisfaction,â said Dan Michaeli, CEO and Co-Founder of Glia.A number of banks and credit unions have already deployed GVAs, seeing a substantial return on investment, including:Â 50%+ containment of customer engagement on average, with some realizing 90%+80% reduction in the Average Wait Time and Average Handle Time24/7/365 service capability for after-hours and holiday coverageThe integration of GVAs into Gliaâs Digital Customer Service offering creates new efficiencies for the deployment and maintenance of virtual assistants on one platform, from a single vendor. This represents significant savings in cost and time compared to internal development using commercial AI platforms. Additionally, they offer shared insights from across the entire GVA user base for best practices.Â âThe proliferation of chatbots and AI technology in general is creating complexity for financial institutions, especially for those developing their own automated solutions. Glia aims to cut through the chaos with virtual assistants that streamline deployment and accelerate time-to-value on our Digital Customer Service platform. Better yet, we continue to enhance the benefit of our GVAs by leveraging our time-tested library of AI-powered responses to help clients meet existing and emerging needs,â said Justin DiPietro, Chief Strategy Officer and Co-Founder of Glia.GVAs are available immediately.

Members can now transition seamlessly between chat, OnScreen voice and video, with online collaboration tools, including CoBrowsing, bringing Dover Federalâs âlegendary serviceâ to the digital realm.Â The efficiencies of the Glia platform have resulted in an ongoing decrease in both the Average Handle Time, down 21% and falling, as well as the Average Wait Time which has dropped 40% to date. This has allowed the Dover Federal member services team to handle a 13% increase in engagements despite havingÂ  fewer staff members. Glia is popular with the service team, providing the tools they need to become strategic guides in helping members online.Â âGlia reshaped how we do business with its 100% digital-first approach. We reimagined everything and completely changed how we engage with our members. This allows us to leverage technology and be leading in our industry,â said Tyler Kuhn, ChiefÂ  Marketing and Digital Experience for Dover Federal Credit Union.Â All-In with DCSBased on the successful results across all digital channels with Glia, Dover Federal deployed Glia Phone to become 100% digital-first. The entire contact center, including the telephone system, is now part of the Glia platform. Even traditional telephone calls are now digital engagements, creating a single source of member data. This makes management, reporting and even staffing easier.âBy going âall-inâ with Gliaâs Digital Customer Service platformâincluding Glia PhoneâDover Federal Credit Union is a powerful example of the value a truly digital-first approach provides. Members are experiencing faster, better services across all channels and employee satisfaction is high,â said Dan Michaeli, Co-Founder and CEO of Glia.Â To learn more about Dover Federal Credit Union and its 100% digital-first approach, read the Dover Federal Case Study.âAbout GliaGlia is reinventing how businesses support their customers in a digital world.
